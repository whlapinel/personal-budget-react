## Instructions for Coding Exercise 03

- Now that you have followed along with the video 06d... and was able to migrate the source code from the old "basic web page" approach to the SPA approach using React... make sure that this code is committed and pushed to your GitHub repo, which is named "personal-budget-react". Then perform the following changes:

1. Bring Axios into your application
2. Bring ChartJS into your application
3. Bring D3JS into your application
4. Implement Axios inside your app... so as to make a call to your backend and get the charts to work on your React app
5. Transform the *.CSS files into *.SCSS (you might need to google "Adding SASS to React")

- After you perform those 5 changes, commit your code and push it to GitHub... and then complete the Assignment (Quiz 06).
